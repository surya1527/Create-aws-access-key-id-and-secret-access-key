Then in the second step you can see three options 

1) Add user to group
2) copy permissions from existing user
3) Attach existing policies directly

In my case click on the third option (Attach existing policies directly)

Then in the third and fourth step if you want to add any keywords then add or else cntinue to the last step.

In the fifth step (Final Step) you can  can see your access key id and secret key id.
(Do not share you access key id  and secret key id to anyone and for a user it is his responsibility to remember his secret key id.)

THEN OPEN YOUR AWS LAMBDA AND WRITE THE PROGRAM TO COPY FILES FROM ONE S3 BUCKEET TO ANOTHER S3 BUCKET AS SOON AS IT IS TRIGGERED IN THE LAUNGUAGE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE.
In my case it is python.

For python code refer to my [repository](https://github.com/surya1527/surya1527-Copy-files-from-one-s3-bucket-to-another-s3-bucket-immediately-by-AWS-LAMBDA)
